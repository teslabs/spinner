  STM32 shunt current sampling driver.

  The shunt current sampling device is expected to be a children of any STM32
  ADC supporting injected conversions. Example usage:

    &adc1 {
      currsmp: currsmp {
        compatible = "st,stm32-currsmp-shunt";
        pinctrl-0 = <&adc1_in1_pa0 &adc1_in7_pc1 &adc1_in6_pc0>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";

        adc-resolution = <12>;
        adc-tsample-us = <2>;
        adc-channels = <1 7 6>;
        adc-trigger = <STM32_ADC_INJ_TRIG_TIM1_TRGO>;
      };
    };

compatible: "st,stm32-currsmp-shunt"

include: [base.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

properties:
  pinctrl-0:
    required: true

  pinctrl-names:
    required: true

  adc-resolution:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      ADC resolution in bits. Available resolutions can differ depending on
      the selected SoC family.

  adc-tsample:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      ADC sampling time in cycles. Decimal sampling times must be rounded
      up, e.g. 19.5 needs to be provided as 20. Available sample times can
      differ depending on the SoC family.

  adc-channels:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      ADC channels (a, b, c).

  adc-trigger:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      External trigger for the injected ADC conversions. The external trigger
      must be an output of the timer used for SV-PWM.

      Definitions available at dts-bindings/adc/stm32fxxx.h files.
