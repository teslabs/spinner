  STM32 SV-PWM device.

  The SV-PWM device is expected to be a children of any STM32 advanced control
  timer. Example usage:

      &timers1 {
          svpwm: svpwm {
              compatible = "st,stm32-svpwm";
              pinctrl-0 = <&tim1_ch1_pa8 &tim1_ch2_pa9 &tim1_ch3_pa10 &tim1_ocp_pa11>;
              ...
          };
      };

compatible: "st,stm32-svpwm"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  pinctrl-0:
    type: phandles
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO pin configuration for inverter signal/s. We expect that the phandles
      will reference pinctrl nodes, e.g.
          pinctrl-0 = <&tim1_ch1_pa8 &tim1_ch2_pa9 ...>;

  enable-comp-outputs:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable complementary outputs, used to control the low side channels of
      each inverter leg.

  t-dead-ns:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Dead time in nanoseconds. If using an integrated controller, i.e. without
      complementary PWM signals, it still needs to be provided to configure
      accurate current measurements.

  t-rise-ns:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Rise time in nanoseconds.

  currsmp:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: |
      Current sampling device.

  enable-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Channel enable GPIOS (a, b, c).
