  STM32 SV-PWM device.

  The SV-PWM device is expected to be a children of any STM32 advanced control
  timer. Example usage:

      &timers1 {
          svpwm: svpwm {
              compatible = "st,stm32-svpwm";
              pinctrl-0 = <&tim1_ch1_pa8 &tim1_ch2_pa9 &tim1_ch3_pa10 &tim1_ocp_pa11>;
              pinctrl-names = "default";
              ...
          };
      };

compatible: "st,stm32-svpwm"

include: [base.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

properties:
  pinctrl-0:
    required: true

  pinctrl-names:
    required: true

  currsmp:
    type: phandle
    required: true
